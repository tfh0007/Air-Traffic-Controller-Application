# This implemetation is based on the following project description:

Air Traffic Control System / Flight Management System: Create an air traffic control system which manages assignment of planes to flights based on occupancy. Passengers with confirmed tickets are assigned seats prior to flight. Flights can be scheduled to depart and arrive at specific airports. A given city may have zero or more airports. Flights belong to a specific airline. Pilots are hired by airlines, along with other staff. Flights can be scheduled based on availability of pilots and departing gates in airport. Upon arrival, flights need to be serviced (clean, refuel, repair, de-ice, restock, etc.). Upon arrival at destination airport, flights can land only upon availability of free gate. Pilot can fly a maximum of only 2 flights or 8 hours per day. Pilots and staff receive feedback from passengers after each flight based on their service satisfaction. Ratings range from 1 to 5. Any pilot / staff member with two consecutive ratings of less than 2 will be fired. If insufficient staff available, airline hires, as per requirement. Flights may be delayed in journey or cancelled prior to departure based on various reasons such as inclement weather, unavailability of pilots, gates, staff, security incidents, etc. System should be highly available and should run for a long time.

# Implementation Requirements (40- Points)

a. Implement the classes from design models, along with attributes and methods.

b. Optional: Implement user interface classes, as required.

c. Optional: Usage of database

d. Note: Evaluation does not include checking for robustness of your code. Completeness and
Correctness will suffice.
