# About the Project
- A fully interactive application that allows users to create and view their tickets
- The application stores and retrieves customers, tickets, and airports from different databases
- The databases were made simple and used consistent formatting
- Part of a Software Modeling and Design Semester Long Project
- Created as a shared GitHub Project
- Designed based on UML diagrams and GRASP Design patterns

## What was Learned
- Learned about creating menu objects and allowing interaction through them
- Used custom Scanner classes to manage the transfer of data betwen the program and the databases
- Created multiple threads to allow for asyncronous operations as well as unique visuals
- Managed the development process and intructed team members on solutions
- Handled and resolved merge conflicts between various git branches that were created
- Used extensive debugging and error checking to find issues with the logic
- Used Exception handeling to prevent user invalid entries from corrupting the program
- Implemented action listeners so the user could interact with objects
- Made the experience unique to every user by gathering data on every customer
